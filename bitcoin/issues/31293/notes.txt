build/test/functional/test_runner.py --ihave1111and2222 build/test/functional/feature_bind_port_discover.py --tmpdir /tmp/ --nocleanup

The Discover() is invoked for 0.0.0.0:.

The fix is in src/init.cpp:
if (bind_addr.has_value()) {
connOptions.bind_on_any |= bind_addr.value().IsBindAny();
connOptions.vBinds.push_back(bind_addr.value());

New functional test added in test/functional/feature_bind_port_discover.py:
self.bind_to_localhost_only = False
self.extra_args = [
['-discover', f'-port={BIND_PORT}'], # bind on any
['-discover', f'-bind={ADDR1}:{BIND_PORT}'],
['-discover', f'-bind=0.0.0.0:{BIND_PORT+1}'],
['-discover', f'-bind=[::]:{BIND_PORT+2}'],
['-discover', f'-bind=::', f'-port={BIND_PORT+3}'],
['-discover', f'-bind=0.0.0.0:{BIND_PORT+4}=onion'],

The log trace (/tmp/test_runner_‚Çø_üèÉ_20241217_234536/feature_bind_port_discover_0/test_framework.log):

So, #31492 looks like a fix candidate to this issue to me.
